<p>Concise plain-speak about Electron.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-electron-">What is Electron?</h2>
<p>Electron is a <span class="def">library</span> you can use to build desktop applications with <span class="def">JavaScript, HTML and CSS</span>. These applications can be packaged to run on Mac, Windows and Linux computers as well as be placed in the Mac and Windows app stores.</p>
<h3 id="next-why-is-this-important-why-is-this-important-">Next: <a href="#why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</a></h3>
<h3 id="definitions-">Definitions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript, HTML and CSS</strong> Are web languages, meaning they are the building blocks of websites and browsers like Chrome know how to turn this code into the visual graphics you see.</li>
<li><strong>Electron is a library</strong> Electron is code that you can re-use and not have to write yourself. You use it to build your project on top of.</li>

<h2 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h2>
<p>Typically, desktop applications for each operating system are written in each&#39;s <span class="def">native language</span>. That can mean having three teams writing three versions of your app. Electron enables you to write your app once and with web languages.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="definitions-">Definitions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>native (operating system) language</strong> These are languages that the major operating systems are (mostly) built with: Mac, Objective C; Linux, C; Windows, C++.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-even-">How, even?</h2>
<p>Electron combines <span class="def">Chromium</span> and <span class="def">Node.js</span> with a set of custom <span class="def">APIs</span> for native operating system functions like open file dialogs, notifications, icons and more. Both Chromium and Node are built on V8 and in Electron they share one instance of it.</p>

<h3 id="definitions-">Definitions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>API</strong> Application Program Interface describes the set of methods made available for you to use (aka interface) a library with.</li>
<li><strong>Chromium</strong> Created by Google, this is the open source library that the browser Chrome is built on.</li>
<li><strong>Node.js</strong> A tool for writing JavaScript on servers (your computer is also a server!).</li>
<li><strong>V8</strong> Chrome and Node.js use V8, an engine that translates JavaScript into the code that can talk directly to the computer or server.</li>

<h2 id="what-s-developing-like-">What&#39;s developing like?</h2>
<p>Developing with Electron is like building web pages that you can seamless use Node in (really!) and only need to <span class="def">work in one browser</span>â€”the latest version of that browser and all the goodies that come along with it like <span class="def">ES2015</span> support and CSS Variables.</p>

<h3 id="definitions-">Definitions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work in one browser</strong> Not all browsers are the same and web designers and developers often have to go the extra mile to make one site look the same on each.</li>
<li><strong>ES2015</strong> Chromium&#39;s V8 supports over 90% of ES2015, the latest updates to JavaScript.</li>
